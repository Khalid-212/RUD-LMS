# Welcome to Ruwad LMS(Learning management system)

Hi i am khalid ibrahim (AKA owner of the project) i have created this system to improve
the process of handling **assignment submission** and  **tracking rewatib**.

More to come...

# The Tech stack

The project is made using [react.js](https://reactjs.org/) pure CRA(create-react-app) for the frontend as well as [redux](https://redux.js.org/)  for state management and for the backend [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)❤️ for the database which is a database as a service that is built on  [Postgres](PostgreSQL:%20The%20world%27s%20most%20advanced%20open%20source%20database%20%20PostgreSQL%20https://www.postgresql.org).
there are also some libraries that are used along the way which i don’t remember but a simple **npm install** will do.

# Folder structure
The folders are structured i a simple way, you have the admin folder which contain the admin pages and the other files and folders are all in the main src folder.

**Admin Folder** contains all the admin routs as a folder every rout have their own folder with their own jsx(yes i use .jsx😊) and css files.

**Pages folder** the user routs are located in the pages folder which also have their own folder with their own jsx and css files.

**Components Folder** is the components folder which contains all the reusable components in the project

**App Folder** contains the store.js file which is the [redux](https://redux.js.org/) store used for state management

**supabase.js** is a file with all the functions you will be using to perform and CRUD opration on the database.

## Running the project

clone the project using the command `git clone https://github.com/Khalid-212/RUD-LMS.git` or download the project and open it using the editor of your choice then run the command `npm install` to install all the dependencies and packages 📦 .

then use the `npm start` command to run the node server which will open the app using your default browser.

then create a branch using the git command git `branch [your branch name]` then switch to that branch using the command `git checkout [the branch name]`

Then start building 👨‍💻 ...

after you are done create a pull request and i will be reviewing the code and if you are lucky your request might be merged to **main** 🤣.
